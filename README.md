# GitHub 404s

A dataset containing non-existant GitHub usernames. Useful for generating usernames that haven't already been taken. The dataset is currently quite small with only ~1.1k examples, however we plan to expand it in future. Each example is a lowercase alphabetical 4-gram. These have been concatenated into a comma-separated string.
